            <p>
                This Code applies to anyone who is engaged by New Zealand Cadet
                Forces, regardless of the position or rank held. This includes
                supplementary staff who are permanent, temporary or casual
                within an NZCF unit, volunteers and any other groups or individuals
                we have advised this Code applies to.
                This Code also applies to what we do outside of the NZCF
                environment where our actions may bring NZCF or NZDF into
                disrepute or may damage the trust and confidence that the NZCF or
                NZDF has in us.

        <article>
            <h1 class="text-heading">How can we be sure our conduct complies with the code and policies?</h1>
            <p>
                The Code provides general guidance and minimum expectations of
                the behaviour NZCF expects from us. No code or policy can cover
                every situation, so we need to consider our values, apply our
                common sense and act with self-respect, and consider the
                reputation of NZCF and NZDF in our decision making.
                The individual circumstances of each situation will determine how
                the misconduct is treated. These examples are intended as
                guidance only. They are not an exhaustive list of breaches of the
                Code of Conduct. Please use the SELF test to guide your decision
                making, or if you need further clarity talk to your Cadet Unit
                Commander or Area Support Officer before you take a course of
                action you think may fall outside the guidance outlined in this
                Code.
            </p>
            <p>
                By being consistently honest and ethical, and applying SELF to our behaviour and decision making, we
                help bring our vision and values to life. <br> <br> What does SELF stand for?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>SCRUTINY - would your decision or behaviour withstand scrutiny and be seen as appropriate by others?
                </li>
                <li>ENSURE COMPLIANCE - does your decision or behaviour comply withthe Code and other NZCF policy, Cadet
                    Force Orders and procedural expectations?</li>
                <li>LAWFUL - is your decision or behaviour lawful?</li>
                <li>FAIR - is your decision or behaviour fair and reasonable?</li>

            <h1 class="text-heading">Reputation and safety</h1>
            <h4>Our reputation</h4>
            <p>
                We act professionally, exercise good judgement and are accountable for our
                behaviour. We must not do anything that may bring the NZCF’s into disrepute. We consider the impact of
                our behaviour on the NZCF and NZDF at all times, including online or in social media, and outside of the
                NZCF environment. We protect the NZCF’s integrity and reputation by speaking up about any inappropriate
                behaviour we see and hear. By addressing inappropriate behaviour either directly or through our command,
                we make the NZCF a safer and happier environment.
            </p>
            <h4>Our influence and conflicts of interest</h4>
            <p>
                A conflict of interest is a situation where our personal, professional or NZCF interests may conflict
                with our position, obligations or responsibilities as a member of the NZCF. Sometimes the appearance or
                perception of such a conflict of interest can be just as damaging as an actual conflict. We must not act
                in a way that uses our influence, role, rank or position to personal advantage or to the advantage of
                others we are associated with. It includes never entering into a sexual or intimate relationship with
                someone we have met in the NZCF environment if an imbalance of power exists, or if that person is
                vulnerable. Instead, we raise potential conflicts of interest with our command chain. By being open and
                honest as soon as we see a potential conflict of interest, we can be supported to ensure it doesn’t
                become a problem.
            </p>
            <h4>Our duty of care</h4>
            <p>
                As a youth focussed organisation we all have a responsibility to lead, train and mentor young persons
                and have a duty of care to take reasonable steps to protect and safeguard Cadets from harm, both
                physical and emotionally. All cadets can expect a safe environment at all times
            </p>
            <h4>Our safety</h4>
            <p>
                The safety and wellbeing of Cadets is paramount. Regardless of our role, we all have responsibility for
                promoting and maintaining a safe NZCF environment. This includes ensuring we are fit and trained to
                safely perform our roles. We keep ourselves, each other and the organisation safe, by appropriately
                managing and reporting any safety issues as soon as we are aware of them.

            <h1 class="text-heading">Resources and Diversity</h1>
            <h4>Our resources</h4>
            <p>
                We have an obligation to properly manage and use resources appropriately and in a way that ensures our
                working environment is safe. We take care of the equipment, tools and resources provided to us
                (including making sure they are fit for use by others) and make sure we use them appropriately, safely
                and for the designated purpose.
            </p>
            <h4>Our diversity</h4>
            <p>
                NZCF is strengthened by diversity. Our differences equip us to be more effective in our approach to
                engaging youth across a wide range of communities. We are committed to having a diverse organisation
                that is inclusive and respectful of each other’s differences. This means we treat all people
                respectfully, with empathy and dignity. We do so whether they are members of the NZCF or not, and
                regardless of the circumstances.
            </p>
            <h4>Our acceptance of others</h4>
            <p>
                We ensure a healthy work environment that does not tolerate discrimination, harassment, bullying,
                victimisation or any other unacceptable or offensive behaviour. There is no place in the NZCF for racial
                or sexual harassment, or discrimination against anyone for any reason including gender, marital status,
                religious belief, ethical belief, colour, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, age, political
                opinion, employment status, family status, or sexual orientation. We are all responsible for ensuring
                this type of behaviour does not occur
            </p>
            <h4>Our history</h4>
            <p>
                The NZCF has a close and unique relationship with the NZDF. We wear a uniform which illustrates this
                special link and signifies the publics trust and confidence in us. This involves certain traditions and
                obligations which form the foundation of our service, and which must be adhered to. When we choose to
                join the NZCF we choose to be responsible forconsistently demonstrating our values, behaving in a
                mannerconsistent with this Code, and seeking help when we are unsure. This isrequired of us all.
